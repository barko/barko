    <p>Here are some of the things I've done professionally:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Engineer</b>: At OneChronos, I'm
	developing novel discrete auction mechanisms to transform the
	way electronic trading works.</li>

      <li><b>Quant Trader</b>: At HFT trading firm Xambala, I
	researched, implemented, and deployed novel high-frequency
	trading strategies in US equities based on novel
	machine-learning techniques, and using a mix of passive and
	aggressive order-placement schemes. I also developed the
	firm's dark-pool order-placement capabilities. I briefly
	worked at FINAL as part of its acquisition of Xambala.</li>

      <li><b>Founder</b>: At EigenDog, I developed and launched a
	web-service for machine learning of gradient boosted tree
	models that scales over large training sets. System operated
	over ensembles of Amazon EC2 resources, which it dynamically
	instantiated in proportion to data volume. Sales efforts led
	to engagements with several customers in retail, online
	advertising, and equities trading.</li>

      <li><b>Engineer, Manager</b>: At Wink, I managed a team of ten
	software engineers and researchers at this consumer internet
	company through its acquisition. Led the design, development,
	and implementation of companyâ€™s core product from inception as
	demo project.
      </li>

      <li><b>Engineer</b>: At DemandTec, I developed statistical
	models to predict the sales volume of retail products. I also
	implemented novel predictive modeling algorithms, used in
	mixed-integer optimization algorithms for maximizing retail
	revenue or profit.</li>

      <li><b>Engineer</b>: At Sun Microelectronics, I developed
	algorithms for optimizing analog circuits for size, power, and
	latency. I also designed software tools for circuit
	verification, and developed parsers for various electronic CAD
	file formats used in verification and synthesis flows.
      </li>

    </ul>
